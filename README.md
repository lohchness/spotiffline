# spotiffline

Do you happen to go on a flight with a 10 hour layover and a 7 hour flight where you potentially have no internet? Do you also happen to use Spotify, not have Premium, but also used to have premium and are not bothered to get it but also want the benefits like no ads (cough blockthespot cough) and offline listening? In that case this repo is for you!
